# Goat Bot V2

## Overview

Goat Bot V2 is a Node.js-based Facebook Messenger chatbot designed for automated interactions via an unofficial Facebook Chat API. It features a command-based system with a plugin architecture, event handling, and a web dashboard for configuration. The bot supports multiple database backends (JSON, SQLite, MongoDB), multi-language capabilities, Google Drive integration for file management, and automated uptime monitoring. Its purpose is to provide a versatile and extensible platform for automating Messenger interactions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Authentication & Session Management

The bot uses `neokex-fca` for cookie-based Facebook authentication, supporting persistent sessions through `appState` JSON storage. It allows various login methods, including email/password and 2FA, with proxy support and session validation.

### Database Layer

An abstracted database layer provides flexibility across deployment environments, supporting JSON (file-based), SQLite (embedded), and MongoDB (scalable, cloud-ready) via a unified repository pattern. This architecture manages `threadsData`, `usersData`, `dashBoardData`, and `globalData` with corresponding models for chat threads, user profiles, dashboard accounts, and global configurations.

### Command & Event System

The bot implements an extensible plugin system with dynamic module loading for commands (`scripts/cmds/`) and events (`scripts/events/`). Each module defines a configuration and handler functions. A role-based permission system (`role: 0` for user, `1` for group admin, `2` for bot admin, `3` for premium user) controls access to commands and features, with bot admins having overarching permissions. The system includes hot-reload support, command aliases, and environment-based configurations.

### Web Dashboard

An Express.js web server with ETA templating, Passport.js authentication, and Socket.IO provides a user-friendly interface for bot configuration. Features include thread-specific settings, Google Drive file uploads, email verification, reCAPTCHA v2 for bot protection, rate limiting, and secure session management with bcrypt for password hashing and CSRF protection.

### Message Handler Architecture

An event-driven architecture processes incoming Facebook messages through a handler chain: `handlerAction.js` routes events, `handlerCheckData.js` ensures data existence, and `handlerEvents.js` validates permissions and routes to specific handlers for message, reply, reaction, and other Facebook event types.

## Recent Changes
